# skiplist-finalproject

The Skip list is an ordered linked list that can realize binary search;

When each element is inserted, its level is randomly generated;

The bottom level contains all elements;

If an element appears at level(x), then it must appear at a level below x;

Each index node contains two pointers, one down and one right;

The time complexity of Skip list Search, insertion and deletion is O(log n), which is close to that of BST;




insert an element

delete an element

find an element

sorted output of all elements

Find elements according to the range interval (for example, find data with a value between [1,10])
